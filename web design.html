    <h1> Web Designer</h1>

    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.
         The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring,
          including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine
           optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, 
           although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design 
           process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially
            overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness 
            of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. <br><br>

        In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and HTML tags.
         It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique
          and is today an important aspect of web design.[6] The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying
           tabular data. However, designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating complex, 
           multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take 
           precedence over good markup structure, little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility.
            HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex 
            designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop
             empty table cells from collapsing.[7] CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and
              layout. This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational and improved web 
              accessibility, see tableless web design. <br><br>

        In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was
         relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to ActionScript, and a 
         timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because 
         Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of 
         compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to GIF animations (if they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) 
         and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to 
         eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.  <br><br>
